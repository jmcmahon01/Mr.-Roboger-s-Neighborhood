# Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood

#### By Joseph McMahon

#### Application that allows user to submit a number and will return a list of values starting from 0 going to the inputted number with substitutions made for any number containing the digits 1, 2, 3. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Web API
* Git Hub


## Description

This website allows user to input a number and, on submission, will show a list of all numbers (starting from 0) up to the inputted number with the following substitutions made: If the number has 1, return "beep". If the number has 2, return "boop". If the number has 3, return "won't you be my neighbor?". If the number returned has a combination of substituted numbers there will be a hierarchy of substitution, meaning the first substitution will return unless the second does and the second substitution will return unless the third does.
